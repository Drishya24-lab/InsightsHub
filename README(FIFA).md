## Introduction

This project leverages FIFA World Cup data to uncover patterns and insights about the tournamentâ€™s history, team performance, player statistics, and attendance. The dataset is analyzed with Python and visualized using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.

## Datasets

The project includes the following datasets:

- **WorldCups.csv**: Contains historical data on FIFA World Cup tournaments, including year, winning team, goals scored, and attendance.
- **WorldCupMatches.csv**: Provides match-level data, including date, teams, stage, and goals scored.
- **WorldCupPlayers.csv**: Contains player-level data for each match, including player name, team, and position.

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Loading datasets, handling missing values, and cleaning the data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing goals scored, team performance, match stages, and attendance.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features like decade and era.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualizing key insights.
5. **Modeling**: Basic Random Forest model for feature importance.
6. **Saving Cleaned Data**: Saving cleaned datasets for future use.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Goals Scored Over the Years
A line plot visualizes the total goals scored each World Cup year.

### Top Teams and Players
- Bar charts identify the teams with the most World Cup wins.
- Analysis of top players by the number of appearances.

### Attendance Trends
A line plot shows the attendance over the years, helping to identify trends in audience engagement.

## Feature Engineering

We created new categorical features:
- **Decade**: Groups each tournament into a decade.
- **Era**: Classifies each tournament as *Early*, *Mid*, or *Modern* based on the year.

## Modeling

Using a RandomForestClassifier, we analyzed feature importance in predicting outcomes. This step highlights which features are most influential.

## Data Visualization

The project includes visualizations such as:
- Line plots for goals scored and attendance trends
- Bar charts for team and player analysis
- Box plots for match outcomes by stage

## Installation

1. Clone this repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FIFA-WorldCup-Analysis.git
2. Install the required libraries
    pip install -r requirements.txt
## Results

Key insights from this analysis include:

- Patterns in goals scored and attendance.
- Dominant teams and players across World Cup history.
- Influential match stages on home and away goals.

## Future Work

Future enhancements to the project may include:

- More complex machine learning models.
- In-depth player performance analysis.
- Predictive modeling on team performances.
